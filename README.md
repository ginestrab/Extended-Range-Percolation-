# Extended-Range-Percolation-
Extended Range Percolation on Simple and Multiplex Networks

This repository contains:

 1.   'ERP_Single.c'

This is a c code to perform both Monte Carlo simulations ERP on single Poisson networks.

2.    'ERP_Multiplex.c'

  This is a c code to perform both Monte Carlo simulations of Extended Range Percolation on Multiplex networks with M=2 Poisson
  layers. It implements both Version 1 and Version 2 of the model defined in the accompaning paper.
